## Description
Welcome to this post-apocalyptic world built with C++ code. Here, you'll play as the leader of a shelter in a world ravaged by a zombie outbreak, guiding survivors to gather resources and explore the environment. Your ultimate goal is to strive to survive for until the day rescue arrives!  
The story unfolds in the year 2025 when a zombie outbreak erupts at HKU. You and your group project teammates have built a makeshift shelter. Survive here long enough to await rescue and secure your chance to live through this catastrophe!
The zombies originate from virus-infected classmates who retain peculiar residual memories, manifesting in behavioral patterns like ceasing activity on weekends. Most crucially, Thursdays hold heightened significance for them – a tactical advantage for survivors but also a harbinger of intensified danger!
Within your sanctuary's limited operational capacity, you and fellow survivors must strategically select a single task per day. Will you harvest gold coins from the mine to upgrade your defensive arsenal, or cultivate crops to sustain your population – with surplus yields even enabling recruitment of new survivors? Strategic allocation of labor will determine your survival odds!
